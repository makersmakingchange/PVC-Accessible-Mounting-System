# PAMS - Small Button Mount
The Small Button Mount is a simple, inexpensive mounting solution to position small buttons on a flat surface. The Small Button Mount is a part of the PVC Assistive Mounting System (PAMS).

The [PVC Assistive Mounting System](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/PVC-Accessible-Mounting-System) is a collection of readily available commercial-off-the-shelf components and 3D printed components that can be assembled into various configurations to provide mounting solutions for assistive technology.
