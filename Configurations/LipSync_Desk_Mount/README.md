# PAMS - LipSync Desk Mount
The LipSync Desk Mount provides a low cost, adjustable configuration to mount the [LipSync](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/lipsync/) to a flat surface like a table or desk. The Lipsync can be attached directly to mount or using different components to provide greater flexibility. The mount attaches to the surface using two c-clamps, which can be purchased in different sizes to accommodate different desk and table thicknesses.   The LipSync Desk Mount is part of the PVC Assistive Mounting System (PAMS).

The [PVC Assistive Mounting System](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/PVC-Accessible-Mounting-System) is a collection of readily available commercial-off-the-shelf components and 3D printed components that can be assembled into various configurations to provide mounting solutions for assistive technology.
