# PAMS - Camera Quick Clamp
The Camera Quick Clamp is an 3D printed adapter for attaching an assistive device to a section of 1/2 inch PVC piping. The clamp has a ¼”- 20 UNC camera thread stud that is compatible with various assistive devices and/or camera mount adapters. The clamp can easily be installed, adjusted, and removed by hand. The Camera Quick Clamp is part of the PVC Assistive Mounting System (PAMS).

The [PVC Assistive Mounting System](TBD) is a collection of readily available commercial-off-the-shelf components and 3D printed components that can be assembled into various configurations to provide mounting solutions for assistive technology.
